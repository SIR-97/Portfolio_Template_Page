# My Portfolio_Template_Page

For this challenge I composed HTML and CSS files in order to create a sample professional portfolio page which I will be able to use over time to develop my own personal portfolio of work. I utilised skills learnt int the first two weeks of the bootcamp and have included the following requirments:

- The Site is divided into several sections: About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
- Navigation links are functional (with the exception of my resume). If a user clicks on any of these sections at the top of the page, then they will be taken to the relevant section.
- I have included an avatar.
- The projects presented under the My Work section are the same as those provided in the challenge breif and are not currently functional. As I work on more projects and applications, then these will be changed to working deployed links that are full functional.   
- The page has been styled for multiple screen sizes such as for tablets and mobile phones.
- I  have included hover over effects for the various links on my work section.
